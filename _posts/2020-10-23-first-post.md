Lately I find myself in need of a place to put down my thoughts and
the pressure of a deadline to actually do so. So I start this without
any expectations that it will be read but still with hope some of you will
find something interesting and useful here regardless. 

As the name of the blog suggests, posts will largely focus on my
interest in the technology of money - starting with a deep exploration
into its history beginning on Monday, November 2nd. Money is one of
those things that is intimately familiar to everyone and yet still
largely a mystery about how or why it even works. With these posts I
hope to explore why it was invented, why it is so ubiquitous across
time, geography and culture, but also understand the times it was lost
or never even  used at all in the first place.

From time to time, I will also use this space to talk about anything
else I find interesting from mathematics and statistics, work flow and
organization, baseball, my struggles to become a better writer and just
general philosophizing about life.

Finally, what this will not become is a space for commentary on the
day-to-day happenings in the world of which there is no shortage
opinions already.

Enjoy!
