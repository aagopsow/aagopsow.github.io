Lately, I find myself in need of a place to put down my thoughts and a
deadline to keep me motivated. I start this project
with no 
expectation that it will be read, yet with hope that it will be
interesting and useful to someone. 

As the name of the blog suggests, posts will largely focus on my
interest in the technology of money -- starting with a deep exploration
into its history. Money is one of those things
that is intimately familiar to everyone, yet the 'how' or 'why' of its
workings remain largely mysterious even to experts. With these posts,
I hope to not only explore why it was invented and why it is so ubiquitous
across time, geography and culture, but also why it was sometimes lost
or never used at all.

From time to time, I will also use this space to talk about anything
else I find interesting: mathematics and statistics, work flow and
organization, baseball, my struggles to become a better writer, and just
general philosophizing about life.

Finally, this will not become a space for commentary on the
day-to-day happenings in the world -- there is no shortage of such
opinions already!

Posts will appear regularly on Monday mornings. 

Enjoy!
