Welcome to my personal blog - a place to share my thoughts on
some topics that interest me. 

For my day job, I write commentary on the Canadian economy
as a labour economist for 
[RBC Economics](https://www.rbc.com/economics/). Please check us out!
Of course, the usual disclaimer applies. These are my own thoughts and
in no way necessarily reflects those of my employer. All errors are my own.
